This is a potential implementation of the OF controller Floodlight v1.0 on OVS to provide a network solution.

OpenFlow is a open standard managed by Open Networking Foundation. It specifies a protocol through whitch a remote controller can modify the behavior of networking devices through a well-defined “forwarding instruction set”. Floodlight is designed to work with the growing number of switches, routers, virtual witches, and access points that support the OpenFlow standard.
